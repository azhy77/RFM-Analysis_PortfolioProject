# RFM-Analysis_PortfolioProject
RFM Analysis is used to understand and segment customers based on their buying behaviour. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value, which are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.

RFM Analysis is a widely utilized concept in the field of Data Science, particularly within the marketing domain. It enables professionals to gain insights into customer behavior and segment customers based on their buying patterns.

By employing RFM Analysis, businesses can evaluate the following aspects of their customers:

1. Recency: This metric captures the date of a customer's most recent purchase. It provides valuable information about how recently a customer has engaged with the business.

2. Frequency: Frequency assesses the rate at which customers make purchases. It sheds light on how often customers engage with the business and make transactions.

3. Monetary value: The monetary value metric quantifies the amount spent by customers on their purchases. It helps businesses understand the financial contribution of each customer.

Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value are key indicators that contribute to understanding customer engagement, loyalty, and overall value to a business. Analyzing these metrics empowers businesses to make informed decisions regarding customer segmentation and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

We will use a dataset which includes Customer ID's , Transaction data & Transaction amounts.Transaction Data includes Purcahse Date, Product Info , Order ID and Loacation.With the above value we can calculate RFM values for different customers and will analyze their patterns & behaviours.
